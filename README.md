# CSE574 Machine Learning Projects

We implemented multiple machine learning alogorithms on various different datasets. Below is the overview of each project assignment 

### Project Assignment 1

#### Dataset: 

1. MNIST -  This dataset consists of a training set of 60000 examples and test set of 10000 examples. All digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed image of 2828 size. In original dataset, each pixel in the image is represented by an integer between 0 and 255, where 0 is black, 255 is white and anything between represents different shade of gray.

2. CelebFaces Attributes - This is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images. CelebA has large diversities, large quantities, and rich annotations, including:
* 10,177 number of identities,
* 202,599 number of face images, and
* 5 landmark locations, 40 binary attributes annotations per image.

#### Algorithms:
1. Neural Network 
2. TensorFlow Library

### Project Assignment 2:

#### Dataset: 

A medical data set is provided in the file \diabetes.pickle" along with the target assignment. The input variables correspond to measurements (physical, physiological, and blood related) for a given patient and the target variable corresponds to the level of diabetic condition in the patient.

#### Algorithms:
1. Gaussian Discriminators - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
2. Linear Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. Gradient Descent for Ridge Regression Learning
5. Non-linear Regression

### Project Assignment 3:

#### Dataset: 
MNIST dataset with feature selection, feature normalization applied to it and divided it into 3 parts: training set, validation set, and testing set.

#### Algorithms:

1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM
